## Testing Principles

- **Test Early and Often:** Write tests alongside development to catch bugs as soon as possible.
- **Automate Testing:** Automate as much as possible to ensure consistent execution.
- **Test for Edge Cases:** Validate edge cases and unusual inputs to ensure robustness.
- **Make Tests Readable:** Write clear, descriptive tests to make debugging easier.

---

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

- **Definition:** Test individual functions or methods in isolation.
- **Purpose:** Ensure that each function produces the expected output for a given input.
- **Examples:**
  - Testing a string manipulation function.
  - Validating arithmetic operations in a class.

### Integration Tests

- **Definition:** Test the interaction between multiple components or modules.
- **Purpose:** Verify that the components work together as expected.
- **Examples:**
  - Testing the interaction between a database and an API endpoint.
  - Validating workflows in multi-component systems.

### Edge Case Tests

- **Definition:** Test unusual or extreme input conditions.
- **Purpose:** Ensure that the system handles all possible inputs gracefully.
- **Examples:**
  - Handling empty, null, or unexpected input types.
  - Large-scale data processing.

### Regression Tests

- **Definition:** Test previously fixed bugs to ensure they do not reappear.
- **Purpose:** Maintain stability as new changes are introduced.
- **Examples:**
  - Re-testing a bug fix in data serialization logic.
  - Running tests from previous releases.

## Writing Tests

### Test Case Structure

Follow a standard structure for each test case:

1. **Setup:** Prepare the necessary input data and environment.
2. **Execution:** Call the function or feature to test.
3. **Verification:** Assert that the output matches the expected result.
4. **Teardown (if needed):** Clean up resources or reset states.

### Checklist for Tests

- **Outputs:**

## Running Tests

### Using the Command Line

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

### Running Specific Tests

- To run a specific test file:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_file_name.py
  ```
- To run a specific test case:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_file_name.py::test_case_name
  ```

### Viewing Test Coverage

Generate a coverage report using `pytest-cov`:

```bash
pytest --cov=your_project tests/
```

---

## Tools and Frameworks

### Testing Frameworks

- **pytest:** Primary testing framework for this project.
- **unittest:** Alternative framework for writing basic test cases.

### Mocking Tools

- **unittest.mock:** Mock dependencies and isolate units for testing.

### Coverage Tools

- **pytest-cov:** Analyse code coverage to ensure all parts of the code are tested.

---

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions

Set up automated testing on every pull request or commit using GitHub Actions.

#### Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.9"
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install pytest pytest-cov
    - name: Run Tests with Coverage
      run: |
        pytest --cov=my_project
    - name: Upload Coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Test Coverage Thresholds

Fail the CI build if code coverage drops below an acceptable threshold. Configure this in `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
cov-fail-under=80
```
